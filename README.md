# ⚡ List Performance Evaluation (ArrayList vs LinkedList)

This project benchmarks and compares the performance of **ArrayList** and **LinkedList** in Java.  
It measures the time taken for adding and removing elements at different positions — beginning, middle, and end — helping to understand the internal performance characteristics of both list implementations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Benchmarks `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`
- Tests the following operations:
  - Add elements at the **beginning**, **middle**, and **end**
  - Remove elements from the **beginning**, **middle**, and **end**
- Uses `System.nanoTime()` for precise performance measurement
- Displays clean, formatted output in milliseconds

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Java Collections Framework (`List`, `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`)
- Big-O time complexity comparison
- Performance benchmarking and profiling
- Efficient looping and memory usage
- Object-Oriented Design (static utility methods)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **JDK:** 17+  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
